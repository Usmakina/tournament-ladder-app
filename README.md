*NOTE*

- This application uses the official tiebreaker rules used in the Magic: The Gathering tournaments. You may see the rules in detail in this link: https://www.wizards.com/dci/downloads/tiebreakers.pdf

- The '1. Match Players' option creates a new round and matches players based on the *current* game statistics. Please remember to finish recording scores before beginning the next round.

- The '5. Finish' option finishes the application and *will close the console*. So if the application is being run in a console, you may select the '2. Show Scores' option to get the final ranking before finishing the tournament.
